Overview

This Python class named RichPipe provides a functional and chainable way to work with Pandas DataFrames. It offers various methods for data manipulation, transformation, and analysis.

Key Features

Functional approach: Methods operate on the DataFrame without modifying it in-place. This allows for easy chaining of operations.
Chaining: Methods return a new RichPipe object, enabling you to perform multiple operations sequentially.
Data cleaning and transformation: Methods for filtering, discarding rows/columns, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Data exploration and analysis: Methods for computing summary statistics, correlation matrix, and pivoting the DataFrame.
Input/output: Methods for reading from and writing to CSV, Excel, and JSON formats.
Class Structure

Imports: Necessary libraries like pandas, numpy, etc. are imported.
Class definition: The RichPipe class is defined.
Constructor (__init__): Initializes the class with a Pandas DataFrame and a unique identifier.
Properties:
want_outlier_indices (getter/setter): Controls whether to store outlier indices during removal.
_id_ (property): Returns the unique identifier of the RichPipe object.
Methods: These methods perform various operations on the DataFrame and return a new RichPipe object. Some notable methods include:
Data selection: project, filter, limit
Data manipulation: discard, map, flat_map, normalize
Merge and join: join_with_smaller, left_join, right_join, inner_join, outer_join
Grouping and aggregation: group_by, pivot, melt
Element-wise operations: applymap
Data transformation: sort, drop_duplicates, fill_na, rename_columns, one_hot_encode, label_encode, standard_scale, min_max_scale, winsorize, robust_scale
Data analysis: describe, corr
Input/output: to_csv, from_csv, to_dict, to_excel, export_to_json
Utility methods: reset_index, add_column, drop_column_by_index, filter_rows_by_index, print_df
Static methods: _df (constructs a RichPipe from a dictionary), _generate_suffixes (helps generate suffixes for join operations)
Docstrings: Most methods have docstrings explaining their purpose, arguments, and return values.
